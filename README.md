# bedly-scrape
Scraper for Bedly's property listings

---
Scrapes relevant information from Bedly.com property listings using Puppeteer and eventually spits out a CSV.

`package.json` has most of the info you need (e.g. `npm start` fires up `supervisor` and runs `server.js`). The whole thing is pretty straightforward.
